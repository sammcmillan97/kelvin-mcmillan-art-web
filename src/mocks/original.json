"description" : "As I crafted Fresh Snow at Lindis Pass, I was inspired by the serene and untouched beauty of New Zealand's winter landscape. In this painting, I sought to capture the essence of Lindis Pass under a blanket of pristine snow. The early morning light, softly illuminating the hills, brings a tranquil glow that contrasts with the distant, shadowed mountains. My aim was to convey not just the visual splendor but also the sense of peace and solitude that a fresh snowfall can bring to such a majestic and untouched environment.",
