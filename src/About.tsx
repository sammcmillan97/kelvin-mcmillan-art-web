      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in South Westland on a dairy farm in Hari Hari. I
        moved to Canterbury in the late 60s.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was interested in art from a young age, becoming a full time artist by
        the age of 22. Initially concentrating on pencil drawings, mainly of
        architectural subjects, finding inspiration in derelict houses and farm
        buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I paint simple subjects that surround me living in the vast landscapes
        of Canterbury and Otago. My painting style depicts the romance of our
        rugged New Zealand landscape. I am captivated by contrasting light and
        dark creating highlights and long shadows on building facades, boats,
        rural railway sidings, beehives and mailboxes. I also love painting
        portraits in particular New Zealandâ€™s rural characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I exhibit widely throughout New Zealand, participating in both group &
        solo exhibitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I married my wife Sally in 1992 and we have two boys: Angus (25) and Sam
        (22).
