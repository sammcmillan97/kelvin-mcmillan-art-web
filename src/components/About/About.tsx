        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in South Westland on a dairy farm in Hari Hari. I
          moved to Canterbury in the late 60s.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was interested in art from a young age, becoming a full time artist by
          the age of 22. Initially concentrating on pencil drawings, mainly of
          architectural subjects, finding inspiration in derelict houses and farm
          buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I paint simple subjects that surround me living in the vast landscapes
          of Canterbury and Otago. My painting style depicts the romance of our
          rugged New Zealand landscape. I am captivated by contrasting light and
          dark creating highlights and long shadows on building facades, boats,
          rural railway sidings, beehives and mailboxes. I also love painting
          portraits in particular New Zealandâ€™s rural characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          I exhibit widely throughout New Zealand, participating in both group &
          solo exhibitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I married my wife Sally in 1992 and we have two boys: Angus ({data.angusBirth}) and Sam
          ({data.samBirth}).
